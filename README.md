# Deep Learning Project

  

### Introduction

Our project involves utilizing deep learning techniques to create Monet-inspired images from photographs. To achieve this, we acquired a dataset from 'kaggle' (we participated in a deep learning kaggle competition) containing both Monet's artworks and regular photographs. We then proceeded to train multiple models using this dataset. The project is composed of two phases: training and testing, and it explores two distinct image style transfer architectures: cycleGAN and neural style transfer.


## Colab notebook structure:

Link to the train colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m5wU8lYFYlx7rGCANmrLA2T3JM7HnxwX?usp=sharing)

The train notebook is divided to 3 parts, data and 2 architectures: CycleGan and Neural Style Transfer using VGG.

## Instructions to run code
Train notebook:

- To run the first model, CycleGan, you need first to run the "Libraries, Data and Defualt Seed" section and then run "CycleGan - Monet paintings" section.

- To run the second model, Neural Style Transfer, you need first to run the "Libraries, Data and Defualt Seed" section and then run "Neural Style Transfer - Monet Paintings" section.

Test notebook:

- To run the first model, CycleGan, you need first to run the "Final Project - Deep Learning - Test Notebook" section and then run "CycleGan - Monet paintings" section and upload a 256x256 photo.

- To run the second model, Neural Style Transfer, you need first to run all and upload a 256x256 photo.
